#### Course description
This course will cover data science approaches for synthesizing, integrating, and analyzing multiple data sources to forecast ecological change. It's a semester long hackathon - hands-on and project-based. Participants will form (potentially interdisciplinary) groups to complete a forecasting project. Datasets will range from field observations to remote sensing and include the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Niwot Long Term Ecological Research (LTER), or other data you might be interested in. We will explore quantitative methods for forecasting appropriate to projects at hand, such as hierarchical models, time series analysis, and machine learning. Data wrangling, visualization, and code management will be critical components too. We will also engage with the emerging community around ecological forecasting, and strive toward results that we could later publish.

#### Learning format
This is a learning-by-doing community of faculty and graduate students based around some real, messy projects using NEON and LTER data.

#### Prerequisite
You should be comfortable around data and coding and be prepared to work in a group. If you have taken a graduate level quantitative class of some kind, you should have skills to contribute. If you're not sure - just ask.

#### The Ultimate Learning Goal
Work as a team to produce a forecast using current best practices.

#### Laptops
This is a hackathon. You should bring a laptop to every class with the necessary tools. If you don't have access to a laptop please let me know as soon as possible. We can totally work something out.

#### Grading
Let's discuss this. Here is one idea:\
Make one tutorial, on a topic to be determined, prepared as a group: 20%\
Forecast project Github repository, developed as a group: 80%

#### Accommodation for Disabilities
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the [Disability Services website](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students). Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or dsinfo@colorado.edu for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions) under the Students tab on the Disability Services website.

#### Classroom Behavior
Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy.  Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.  For more information, see the policies on [classroom behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) and the [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/).

#### Honor Code
All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (honor@colorado.edu); 303-492-5550). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the [Honor Code Office website](https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code).

#### Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation
The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to fostering a positive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, exploitation, harassment, dating or domestic violence, and stalking), discrimination, and harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or cureport@colorado.edu. Information about the OIEC, university policies, [anonymous reporting](https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PnqVK4kkIJIZnf), and the campus resources can be found on the [OIEC website](http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/).

Please know that faculty and instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about options for reporting and support resources.

#### Religious Holidays
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. In this class, in most cases you should have sufficient time to complete the assignments and submit them on time, or early if appropriate. If this does not work for your situation, please notify me at least two weeks in advance of the conflict to request special accommodation. See the [campus policy regarding religious observances](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams) for full details.
