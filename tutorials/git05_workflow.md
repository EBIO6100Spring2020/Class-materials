# Git workflow for collaborating on forecasting projects

We'll agree on a workflow that is appropriate. It will probably go something like this:
* Assign tasks
* Pull master from GitHub
* Make a new branch for a task
* Work on the task and commit changes
* If no discussion needed
  * Pull master from GitHub to update
  * Merge task branch into master
  * Push master to GitHub
* Else
  * Push task branch to GitHub
  * Submit pull request in GitHub
  * Discuss as necessary
  * Merge task branch into master
