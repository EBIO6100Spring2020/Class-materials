* **Prep:**
  * none
* Introductions to each other
* What is forecasting? Why and how might we do it?
* [Slides week 1](01_slides.pdf)
* Discussion of project ideas

#### Week 2
* **Reading:** Dietze 2018 Ecological Forecasting, Chapter 2
* **Prep:**
  * Talk with each other about projects and form groups
* Discussion of project ideas
* [Slides week 2](02_slides.pdf)
* [List of project ideas](02_project_ideas.md)

#### Week 3
* **Reading:** Dietze 2018 Ecological Forecasting, Chapter 2
  * This chapter focuses on uncertainty.
* **Prep:**
  * Talk with each other about projects and form groups
    * Review the project ideas that we discussed last week
    * Express interest in projects by visiting the `Issues` tab in the [Data-sandbox repository](https://github.com/EBIO6100Spring2020/Data-sandbox)
  * Send me your GitHub username so I can add you to the class's GitHub organization
    * New to GitHub? [Signup](https://github.com/) with your colorado.edu email.
  * [Git tutorials](tutorials). New users do setup + basics.
  * Get hacking to wrangle and visualize data
    * Use the [Data-sandbox repository](https://github.com/EBIO6100Spring2020/Data-sandbox) (see instructions there)
    * [Tutorials](tutorials) for data wrangling and visualization (ggplot, dplyr, tidy)
    * [NEON data](https://www.neonscience.org/)
    * [Niwot data](https://nwt.lternet.edu/data-catalog) - and see [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Todaiop6BTS8-CipZFkF9vwBUECzHxKn) for Sarah's list of signature datasets.
* [Slides week 3](03_slides.pdf)
* Hackathon - data visualization

#### Week 4
* **Reading:** [Harris et al. 2018. Forecasting biodiversity in breeding birds using best practices](https://peerj.com/articles/4278/)
  * This example provides a good overview of issues and methods
* **Prep:**
  * Continue hacking to wrangle and visualize data
  * Use GitHub `Issues` to organize and coordinate
  * [Git tutorials](tutorials). Review or learn to use branching & teamwork tools. See [git05_workflow tutorial](tutorials/git05_workflow.md) for a suggested way for us all to work together on the same repository.
* [Slides week 4](04_slides.pdf)
